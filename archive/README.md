Preserved for reference. Not part of active development.

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **phase1** | QGIS-based satellite imagery acquisition and boundary extraction |
| **ROADMAP.md** | Original course-builder AI automation roadmap (Grounding DINO, MCP, etc.) |
| **GROUNDING-DINO.md** | Grounding DINO integration spec (dropped from current roadmap) |
| **workspace_high_bridge** | Phase 1 workspace / QGIS project files |
| **python-agent-phase1-actions** | Python agent Phase1 (geocoding, DEM, heightmap) actions; archived in favor of SegFormer-focused Phase 1A only |

Active work follows the [4-phase roadmap](../docs/ROADMAP.md). **Phase 1** (splining from sat + lidar) = phase1_1 + phase1a. The **python-agent** exposes Phase 1A actions only (SegFormer + SAM).
